## Title: Analysis of Association of Cardiovascular Disease Mortality and Fast Food Restaurant Density


## Executive Summary:

Cardiovascular diseases remains the top chronic diseases resulting in increased deaths World Wide and in the US. Diabetes, Overweight and Obesity, Hypertension, smoking and poor lifestyle choices are the major risk factors associated with increased incidence of Cardiovascular disease. As a Biomedical Scientist, I strongly believe that a healthy life style changes can atleast prevent the risk factors associated with Cardiovascular diseases. Risk factors like genetic causes, Diabetes, Family History, Age, Gender, and ethincity cannot be changed, while increasing physical activity, stopping smoking, and eating healthy diet can improve the health and reduce the overalll risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. As part of the Midstone datascience project at Nashville Software School, I came across two recent studies that suggested an  association of Fast Food restaurants density and Cardiovascular disease incidence. I was curious about this association and built a Shiny app to visualize the association of fast food restaurants density, Cardiovascular disease mortality and other confounding factors that have shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease incidence, that can be both informative and useful.

## Data Question: 
1.How are the mortality rate and prevalence of cardiovascular disease changed over time?
2.Is there an association between the density of fast food restaurants and  cardiovascular disease deaths, diabetes prevalence, Obesity, and socioeconomic factors.
