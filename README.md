## Analysis of Association of Cardiovascular Disease Mortality and Fast Food Restaurant Density


## Executive Summary:

Cardiovascular diseases remains the top chronic diseases resulting in increased deaths World Wide and in the US. Diabetes, Overweight and Obesity, Hypertension, smoking and poor lifestyle choices are the major risk factors associated with increased incidence of Cardiovascular disease. As a Biomedical  Scientist and an interest in studying chronic diseases  I would like to understand the risk factors associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases.

##Motivation:
My interest in building the Shiny App is to visualize the association of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and poor food choices. 
As a Biomedical scientist, and with a family history of risk factors associated with the cardiovascular disease, I am interested in finding out, is there an association between poor food choices and a higher incidence of risk for cardiovascular disease? 
Data Question

## Data Question: 
How are the mortality rate and prevalence of cardiovascular disease changed over time?
Is there an association between the density of fast food restaurants and  cardiovascular disease deaths?
